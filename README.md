# Dotfiles
My installation scripts and configuration files for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). They are largely influenced by [Matthieu Cneude](https://github.com/Phantas0s) and his book [Building your Mouseless Development Environment](https://themouseless.dev/).

The setup consists of the following parts.

- Font: *Inconsolata Nerd Font*
- Desktop: *X11*, *i3*, *Rofi*
- Terminal: *rxvt-unicode*
- Multiplexer: *tmux*
- Shell: *Zsh*
- Editor: *Neovim*

The setup is configured with VIM like [keystrokes](./keystrokes.md).
